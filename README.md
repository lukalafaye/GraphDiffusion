# GraphDiffusion

Run notebook on Google Colab for compoatible CUDA version support.
This is an implementation of the EFFICIENT AND SCALABLE GRAPH GENERATION THROUGH ITERATIVE LOCAL EXPANSION paper.

The coarsening methodology was simplified.

There is also some slides explaining the paper approach and results on two experiments (see notebook).
